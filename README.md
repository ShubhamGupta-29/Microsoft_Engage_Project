## Movie Recommendation System
Simple yet powerful recommendation system built for Microsoft Engage Program 2022 using the K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN) Algorithm which helps in Content based search with some additional features of Web Scrapping.

So my algorithm works in this way suppose there are two categories, i.e., Category A and Category B, and we have a new data point x1, so this data point will lie in which of these categories. To solve this type of problem, we need a K-NN algorithm. With the help of K-NN, we can easily identify the category or class of a particular dataset. Consider the below diagram:

### Advantages of my Project
-It is simple to implement.

-It is robust to the noisy training data

-It can be more effective if the training data is large.

### Source
